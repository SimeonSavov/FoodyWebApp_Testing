# FoodyWebApp_Testing
Welcome to the Foody Web Application Testing repository. This repository documents my comprehensive testing efforts on the Foody web application. As a manual tester, my primary goal is to ensure that the application functions seamlessly as per the specified use cases. This involves creating test cases, identifying and thoroughly documenting any discovered bugs, and maintaining detailed records using the provided Test Management and Bug Tracker Template.
